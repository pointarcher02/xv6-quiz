## Answers

Ans 1:- A Unit-like operating system
Ans 2:- BSD
Ans 3:- Simple
Ans 4:- As Interrupts
Ans 5:- 128
Ans 6:- Sh
Ans 7:- Round-Robin scheduling
Ans 8:- Paging
Ans 9:- Both b and c
Ans 10:- No
Ans 11:- MIT

Ans 12:- In XV6, a process can be in one of the following states:

   UNUSED: The process table entry is not in use.
   EMBRYO: The process is in the process of being created.
   SLEEPING: The process is waiting for some event to occur.
   RUNNABLE: The process is ready to run but waiting for the CPU.
   RUNNING: The process is currently being executed.
   ZOMBIE: The process has terminated but is still in the process table until the parent acknowledges its termination.

Ans 13:- The XV6 file system has a simple structure. Key components include:

   Superblock: Contains information about the file system, such as the number of blocks and inodes.
   Inodes: Represent files and directories and store metadata.
   Data Blocks: Store file contents and directory information.
   Root Directory: The top-level directory in the file system.

Ans 14:-    System Calls: Interface between user programs and the operating system kernel. Examples in XV6 include fork(), exec(), and exit().
            Library Functions: Provided by C libraries and are not part of the kernel. They are built on top of system calls. Examples in XV6 include printf(), scanf(), etc.

Ans 15:-     Paging in XV6 works as the memory is divided into fixed-size pages, and the page table is used to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.
             Benefits: Allows for efficient use of memory, enables easy sharing of code and data, and facilitates the implementation of virtual memory.

Ans 16:- ls: Lists directory contents.
         cd: Changes the current directory.
         cp: Copies files or directories.

Ans 17:-     Process synchronization ensures orderly execution of processes. It is essential to prevent conflicts and data corruption.
             Mechanisms: XV6 uses techniques like locks and semaphores for synchronization.

Ans 18:-     Role of Interrupts: Interrupts are used to signal the CPU that an event has occurred and requires immediate attention.
             Handling: XV6 handles interrupts using interrupt service routines (ISRs) that are invoked in response to specific interrupt signals.

Ans 19:-     Virtual Memory: Provides the illusion of a larger, contiguous memory space than physically available.
             Implementation in XV6: Achieved through paging, allowing processes to have their own virtual address space.
             Advantages: Enables efficient memory utilization and process isolation.
             
Ans 20 :-     Power On: CPU initializes, and the BIOS/UEFI firmware is executed.
              Bootloader: Loads the XV6 bootloader, which in turn loads the XV6 kernel into memory.
              Kernel Initialization: XV6 kernel initializes the system, sets up memory, and begins executing the first user-level process.
